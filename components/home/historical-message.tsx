            In the early part of 1985, a few of us (parishioners) from
            the Church visited our Priest at the time, the Rev. Fr.
            Ivan Yangyouru, a Lecturer then of the Sociology
            Department (now of blessed memory). We were surprised to
            see several very happy students at what seemed like a
            party. Jokingly, we asked why we were not invited to the
            party! Fr. Ivan, in his usual very calm voice, said that
            it was a very normal Sunday afternoon at his house with
            &ldquo;small refreshments&rdquo;.
            <br />
            <br />
            We were very impressed that he had such an activity going
            on every Sunday afternoon on his meager Lecturer&apos;s
            salary, particularly at that time when there was a general
            shortage of almost everything in the country. Not long
            after this, we discovered that those were needy/poor
            students, he was supporting at the University all by
            himself.
