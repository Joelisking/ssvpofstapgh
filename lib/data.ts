The plight of this community was brought to the fore of the society by a member who was informed of the harsh living conditions of the people before and after the Akosombo Dam Spillage. The society then agreed to support them to the best of their ability. As the charity arm of the parish, the society agreed that this should be the charity activity for the Parish for Lent, thus the society would spear-head the Lenten Charity activity of the parish for 2024 with a visit and a donation of items to the people of Djorkpo-Abuvienu. The mode of raising funds for this activity will be donations from parishioners, donations from members and token from the SSVP of STAP coffers. The society had proposed in December 2023 that members are allowed to make their donations on monthly basis. The committee members for the activity are Bro. Derric Owusu Tinkler, Bro. Gabriel Ankasiba, Sis. Nana Ama Adomako, Sis. Joana Guo, Sis. Josephine Ecklu and Bro. Joseph Edward Yawson.
